# Customizing Directus
Directus is minimally stylized and completely unbranded. This means that the system can be completely branded to match the client/project with little effort. This is especially important when building a platform with user visible components such as a POS. As an administrator you can tailor the system's label and logo (170x100) within `Settings > Global Settings`.
