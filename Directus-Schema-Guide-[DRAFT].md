## Your Tables
The fundamental purpose of Directus is to allow developers to design and create schemas specifically around the needs of their project's scale, performance, architecture, and extensibility. While Directus tries to make no assumptions about your data, there are a few standards which (as of now) should be followed:

* `id`
* `active`
* `sort`


## Directus Proprietary Tables

This page will give an overview of the proprietary Directus tables that are included in each install. The purpose of these tables is simple â€“ to decouple all Directus proprietary information from your data. This means that at any point you can delete the "directus_" tables and be left with a _pure_ database (schema and data) of your design.

###`directus_activity`

###`directus_bookmarks`

###`directus_columns`

###`directus_files`

###`directus_groups`

###`directus_messages`

###`directus_messages_recipients`

###`directus_preferences`

###`directus_privileges`
Each row on this table is associated with a table (`table_name`) and a Directus user group (`group_id`). Optionally, you can increase the fidelity of your privileges by setting the `status_id` to a an allowed status integer. For instance, you can define a user-group's view privileges for a table specifically  when the _status_ of a record is in draft mode. This might be useful if you'd like your "intern" user-group to only see draft content (not live/published).

The `read_field_blacklist` functions by omitting the given column from the database schema which the API yields, such that the front-end app has no awareness of this column. The `write_field_blacklist` prevents that user group from writing to this column.

The `nav_listed` boolean is used to hide certain tables from the Directus sidebar and table listing. In certain cases you may want records to be visible throughout the CMS (relationally or otherwise) but you don't need that table listed prominently otherwise. You can also use `directus_groups.nav_override` to achieve similar results, but for simply hiding a few tables that might be overkill.

The allow_[permission] columns determine which operations the group may perform on this table. Possible values are: `0` (not allowed), `1` (allowed for content you created), `2` (allowed for content anyone created). To differentiate between who created content (and take advantage of these granular privileges), you must set `directus_tables.user_create_column` to the field within that table which will track the Directus User-ID of the creator.
* `allow_view` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to view a table. Without this permission, the table will be completely omitted from the schema of users in this group.
* `allow_add` - [0,**1**] The ability to add new items to this table. A value of `2` is not an option since you can't _create_ someone else's content.
* `allow_edit` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to edit items from this table.
* `allow_delete` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to delete items from this table. 
* `allow_alter` - [0,**1**] The ability to modify the table's schema.
