# Branding & Style
*Directus is minimally stylized and completely unbranded. This means that the system can be completely branded to match the client/project with little effort. This is especially important when building a platform with user visible components such as a POS.*

### Changing/Adding your logo
As an administrator you can tailor the system's label and logo (170x100) within `Settings > Global Settings`. Use a PNG with alpha-transparency for a more polished look.

# Users, Groups, & Permissions
Directus is accessed by the authorized users within **`directus_users`**. Each user is assigned to a single group within **`directus_groups`**. Each user-group has its table/field access-control permissions set within **`directus_privileges`**.

### IP Whitelisting for User-Groups
If your project requires that certain user-groups have access limited to specific IP addresses you can set their **`directus_groups->restrict_to_ip_whitelist`** to `1`. Then enter any allowed IP addresses (and a brief description) into the **`directus_ip_whitelist`** table. 

### Sidebar Navigation Blacklist for User-Groups
By default, Directus shows all tables that the current user's group has `list` and `view` access to. To hide certain tables from this list on a group basis, simply enter a CSV of table names into **`directus_tab_privileges.directus_tab_blacklist`**.

### Customizing the Sidebar Navigation for User-Groups
By default, Directus displays all available tables alphabetically in the navigation sidebar under the "Tables" group header. To customize this you can build a tailored JSON string and save it within **`directus_tab_privileges->nav_override`** for the desired user group.
