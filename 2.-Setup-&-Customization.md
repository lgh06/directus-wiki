# Global Settings
* **Site Name:** The name of your project that appears in the browser title
* **Site URL:** Clicking the main logo takes you to this URL
* **CMS User Auto Sign Out:** The number of minutes before a user is automatically logged out of Directus
* **Rows Per Page:** The number of items shown on each item listing page
* **CMS Thumbnail URL:** Directus is minimally stylized and internally unbranded. This means that the system can be tailored to match the client/project with little effort. This is especially important when building a platform with user visible components such as a POS.*

### Changing/Adding your logo
As an administrator you can tailor the system's label and logo (170x100) within `Settings > Global Settings`. Use a PNG with alpha-transparency for a more polished look.

# Files & Thumbnail Settings
* **File File Naming:** Confusing title, this determines the filename for uploaded files.
* **File Title Naming:** This is the method for creating a file's DB saved reference title.
* **Thumbnail Quality:** 0-100 – This is the jpg quality for system thumbnails used within Directus (this value does not influence your original files)
* **Thumbnail Crop Enabled:** When checked, Directus will generate system thumbnails for images as a square – other aspect ratios will be cropped to a square. If unchecked, Directus will generate scaled down system thumbnails that maintain their aspect ratio (uncropped).

# Users, Groups, & Permissions
Directus is accessed by the authorized users within **`directus_users`**. Each user is assigned to a single group within **`directus_groups`**. Each user-group has its table/field access-control permissions set within **`directus_privileges`**.

### IP Whitelisting for User-Groups
If your project requires that certain user-groups have access limited to specific IP addresses you can set their **`directus_groups->restrict_to_ip_whitelist`** to `1`. Then enter any allowed IP addresses (and a brief description) into the **`directus_ip_whitelist`** table. 

### Sidebar Navigation Blacklist for User-Groups
By default, Directus shows all tables that the current user's group has `list` and `view` access to. To hide certain tables from this list on a group basis, simply enter a CSV of table names into **`directus_tab_privileges.directus_tab_blacklist`**.

### Customizing the Sidebar Navigation for User-Groups
By default, Directus displays all available tables alphabetically in the navigation sidebar under the "Tables" group header. To customize this you can build a tailored JSON string and save it within **`directus_tab_privileges->nav_override`** for the desired user group.

```
{
    "Office": {
        "Staff": {
            "path": "/tables/staff"
        },
        "Locations": {
            "path": "/tables/locations"
        }
    },
    "Portfolio": {
        "Projects/Work": {
            "path": "/tables/projects"
        },
        "Clients (Brands)": {
            "path": "/tables/clients"
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Data Workflow
Tables containing a status column (default column name of `active`) track the publish state of their items/records. Initially, options of `Live`(1), `Draft`(2), and `Deleted`(0) are all options for all tables with a status column. These options, and their associated display-color and saved-value, are [editable and extendable within the configuration.php file](https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/wiki/1.-Installation-&-Configuration#apiconfigurationphp).

Furthermore, all table permissions for user-groups can be assigned globally or for specific status states. The following should outline this extensive level of customization:

* Every Directus `user` belongs to a single `user-group`
* Each `user-group` has adjustable `view`, `add`, `edit`, and `delete` permissions (admins also have `alter`) every table
* The `view`, `edit`, and `delete` permissions also have respective "big" variations able to distinguish between item's the *current user* created versus an item *any* user created. This gives the ability to restrict permissions based on if it's "yours". (This option requires a "magic owner column" which tells Directus which field in the table stores the creator's `directus_user.id`)
* Each `user-group` also has control over `read` and `write` for every field within every table
* All of the above permissions can be assigned at the global level, or, for tables with a status column, individually for each available status state (such as `draft` or `deleted`).

To create a custom data workflow for your users simply set different permissions for each individual status state. This will allow you to restrict which status options are available to users, when they're editing an item of a given state.

# Tables & Input Settings

## Table Options
* **Hidden:** Determines if the table is hidden (not restricted) from all users. This affects the sidebar navigation and table-listing page.
* **Single:** While not a traditional way to architect a database, sometimes you may find yourself with a table intended to contain only a single record. Perhaps you want to manage data/fields specific to a single website page such as the homepage. Add any desired fields to a table and mark it as "single" – this will bypass the item listing page when being accessed since there is only one item. (Directus assumes a id of 1)
* **Junction Table:** Mark any junction tables (aka: *cross-reference table, bridge table, join table, map table, intersection table*) as such so that directus is aware.
* **Footer:** Turning on the footer will add useful dynamic info to the bottom of the item listing page tabular data. Including:
    * **SUM** Adds up all column values from each visible item
    * **MIN** Shows the lowest column value within all visible items
    * **MAX** Shows the highest column value within all visible items
    * **AVG** Shows the average of all column values within all visible items

## Field Options
Clicking the table name on **Settings > Tables & Inputs** page will give you additional options at the field level. System fields are displayed grayed out at the top, and lack options.

* **Reordering Fields** Using the handle on the far left of each column you can adjust the presented order of fields on the edit page.
* **Field** This is the column name, hover over the text to see the db data-type. Column names run through a Directus prettify function to be more presentable system-wide; underscores become spaces, words become Title Case, and certain letter-pairings are given special capitalization (such as "pH" or "iOS"). To the right of the text for relational field aliases are indicators of the relationship type (such as "⊢⊣" for many-to-many).
* **Input Type** This is one of the key aspects of Directus – here you can change from the default input UI for each column. Based on the datatype of the column (varchar, tinyint) certain core/custom input interfaces are allowed. For instance, you may have an `INT` column named `hero_image` – by default this Directus input would be a numeric only text input. But the column's "Input Type" dropdown will allow you to make it a file upload interface on the edit page that stores a relational file.id. For more information about creating custom UIs for certain datatypes, [click here](https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/wiki/4.-Extending-Directus#custom-inputs-uis).
* **Input Type Options (gear icon)** Clicking the gear opens an overlay containing all options for the chosen Input Type. For example, if the Input Type is "WYSIWYG Editor" then options include changing which buttons are displayed for this field – so, only *bold* and *italics*, for instance.
* **Hidden** Checking this will globally hide this field from listing and edit pages for all groups.
* **Required** Checking this will enforce the "validate" function within the UI. Required fields will have an asterisk beside them on the item edit page. UIs may treat "required" in different ways... some odd ones include, a required checkbox or slider.
* **Primary** This radio button denotes which field within this table best represents it uniquely. It is used on pages like activity, where items need to be referred to contextually.
* **Note** Use this to add additional field info or notes on the item edit page. Since Directus uses field names as input labels this can help add clarity for field use. It can help guide required pixel dimensions for image inputs, or remind users of formatting. It does allow for the use of HTML – but use that with care.
