# Getting Started

## Composer dependency management

The Directus API is written in PHP and employs a number of third-party, open-source packages to manage routing, rendering, database access, and so on. See the core Composer documentation [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgetcomposer.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhxf8df2A4nLZIZrCVBRdpgDtF9Q).

Best practice [says](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgetcomposer.org%2Fdoc%2F01-basic-usage.md%23composer-lock-the-lock-file&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFiTope9TfHBzLrje3eM8CW_efAAg) that the composer.lock file should be tracked in the application repository. This helps to ensure stability by guaranteeing that over time, and across the development team, the versions of application dependencies will not change with each installation, but will remain exactly the same.

This is especially critical from the perspective of Directus code integration and inter-dependency integration. Case in point: the Slim package introduces in version 2.4 breaking changes in its integration with Twig. Therefore changes to the composer.lock file are extremely sensitive. Here are some guidelines on how to modify Directus’ composer dependencies.

### Never run composer.phar update
* This “updates” the version of each dependency to the latest version.
* If for whatever reason you need to re-install your vendors, always instead remove your vendor directory and re-run `composer.phar install`

### Avoid modifying the composer.json file directly
* Always modify dependencies using composer.phar because it will modify the lock file directly
* For example, to add a new dependency, run this command:
  * `composer.phar [require](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require) vendor/package:version`
  * This command updates your JSON file and your lockfile without changing the versions of your other dependencies.

## Requirements

* Apache HTTP Server
* MySQL Server
* PHP >5.2
* Git
* Composer

## Development Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Setup a development environment
You will need to setup a local *AMP environment (Apache, MySQL and PHP) in order to test Directus. *AMP packages can be found for different platforms:

* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) for Mac OS
* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows
* [LAMP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) for Linux

### Step 2: Install git
You will need Git to keep your test version of Directus up to date. Unless you already have Git installed, you can download it from [here](http://git-scm.com/).

### Step 3: Pull down Directus from github
Create a directory named "directus" in the www root. Next, open the directory in the terminal and type:

```
$ git init
$ git clone https://github.com/RNGR/directus6
```
### Step 4: Install dependencies
Directus uses composer to handle its php dependencies. Go to the `directus/api/` folder and install composer:

```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Then install the dependencies by executing:

```
$ php composer.phar install
```

### Step 5: Setup the database
The AMP-packages listed above all include Phpmyadmin. The following three steps need to be completed in order to setup the database

1. Create the database
   1. Databases -> Create Database
   2. Type *directus* as name and select *utf8_general_ci* as Collation.
2. Create a user
   1. Once you've created the database it will be visible in the left column – open it by clicking it.
   2. Privileges -> Add user
   3. Fill in *username* and *password*. Leave the other fields as defaults.
3. Import the database schema
   1. Import->File to Import->Choose file
   2. Open api/schema.sql
   3. Press Go

### Step 6: Setup Directus
Open `directus/api/config_sample.php` Add the database username and password from Step 5 to *DB_USER* and *DB_PASSWORD*. Save the file as ```directus/api/config.php```

```
define('DB_USER', 		'myusername');
define('DB_PASSWORD',	'mypassword');
```
### Step 7: Setup Files Uploads
This requires configuring your Storage Adapters. Currently the best way to do this is to manually edit the `directus_storage_adapters` table using a SQL client.

By default, `directus.sql` should contain two storage adapters out of the box, with the `DEFAULT` and `THUMBNAIL` roles, both using the `FileSystemAdapter` (meaning these will map to your local hard drive).

Simply define the `destination` (absolute path) and `url` (equivalent URL to the same directory) parameters of each of these records. For example, using a MAMP setup, you might define them this way:

```
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 1;
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media-thumbnails/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media-thumbnails/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 2;
```

### Step 8: Done!
Open directus by navigating to the path *directus* in your local host. Log in using the default user *admin@example.com* and password *password*


# Directus Folder Structure & Key Files

* **api**
    * Contains all server-side and lightly-abstracted database code.
* **app**
    * Contains all client-side application code.
    * core
    * **core-ui**
        * Contains all user-interfaces available within Directus core. These UIs should not be edited, deleted or added to – any UI customizations should be added to `/ui`.
    * modules
    * schema
    * **templates**
        * Contains all page html/handlebars markup for Directus
* **assets**
    * Contains all referenced less, js, css, font, and image files. The unbranded aspect of Directus means there should be no need to edit anything in this folder. All custom css and javascript should live within proprietary UIs, extensions, or list-views (see below).
* **bin**
* **dist**
* **extensions**
    * Contains any proprietary extensions your project may use. Extensions are a catch-all for CMS functionality, if it can't be handled by Directus core or UIs, then extensions are a sandbox for any Each extension present here is automatically loaded into the system unless prepended with an underscore ("_example"). Extensions are self contained, so all templates, logic, etc is within its own folder – for initial setup use the provided example as a guideline... just remember to remove the prepended underscore to activate.
* **installation**
    * Contains all the necessary files to install and setup Directus. Once completed, this entire folder can and should be removed. 
* **listviews**
    * Contains custom templates for proprietary item listing pages. As a primer, reference the core list views within `app/modules/xxx/views` until a proper example list view is included.
* **media_auth_proxy**
* **node_modules**
* **ui**
    * Contains custom UIs (user interfaces) which are used as the inputs for data within the framework. Proprietary UIs in this folder are supplementary to the _core_ UIs located within: `app/core-ui` – though the file structure/syntax is identical other than location. An `exampleui.js` file is included, but for more a more comprehensive understanding the core UIs should be perused. Any UIs added to this folder will be immediately available after refreshing the framework.

# Access Control Layer (ACL)

The access control layer was built in response to the need to maintain the privacy and integrity of certain pieces of data within the database, as managed by Directus. This functionality allows Directus administrators to prevent certain groups from reading and writing to specific fields, and from performing certain operations on given tables.

### The `directus_privileges` table
Each row on this table is associated with a table (`table_name`) and a Directus user group (`group_id`). The `permissions` column itemizes which operations the group may perform on this table.

The `read_field_blacklist` functions by omitting the given column from the database schema which the API yields, such that the front-end app has no awareness of this column. The `write_field_blacklist` prevents that user group from writing to this column.

_The `permissions` column can contain the following, comma-separated values:_
* `add` - The ability to insert into the table.
* `alter` - The ability to modify the schema.
* `bigdelete` - The ability to delete records not owned by the current user. (This applies to all records if the table has no “magic owner column” configured.)
* `bigedit` - The ability to edit records not owned by the current user. (This applies to all records if the table has no “magic owner column” configured.)
* `delete` - The ability to delete records owned by the current user. (Requires that the table has a “magic owner column” configured.)
* `edit` - The ability to edit records owned by the current user. (Requires that the table has a “magic owner column” configured.)
* `view` - The ability to view the table. (Without this permission, the table will be completely omitted from that user’s schema.)

### The magic owner column
In order to make effective use of the `bigdelete`, `bigedit`, `delete`, and `edit` permissions, you need to define the “magic owner column” for the table in question.

This is the column which is defined as containing the ID of the Directus User who “owns” a given record.

Define the “magic owner column” by populating the `directus_tables . magic_owner_column` value for the desired table.

_This field by default should contain these values for the following core Directus tables:_
* `directus_users => id`
* `directus_media => user`
* `directus_bookmarks => user`
* `directus_preferences => user`

### The `directus_tab_privileges` table
This table allows you to create a tab blacklist per user group.
