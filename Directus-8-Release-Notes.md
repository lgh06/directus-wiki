# IMPORTANT: Read through the entire list of breaking changes _before_ upgrading production projects to Directus 8. Always perform a full database backup before upgrading.

## ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
* ðŸ’¥ The Admin App now expects to be in the APIâ€™s `/public` folder
* ðŸ’¥ The `config/api.php` no longer maps to the default project (eg: `_`). All project keys are defined by their respective config file's name.
* ðŸ’¥ The `app` and `settings` keys in the config file have been removed
* ðŸ’¥ Password reset flow is now a `POST` request instead of a `GET`

## ðŸš€ Migration Guide (v7-v8)
1. Rename the config files to your desired project names (eg `/config/api.my-project.php` to `/config/my-project.php`). Note: if you'd like to keep using `_` as your project name, rename the `/config/api.php` file to `/config/_.php`). Remove `api_sample.php`, `migrations.php`, and `migrations.upgrades.php`.
2. Update `app` and `settings` in your project config file to reflect the following changes:

```
BEFORE-----------------------------------

'app' => [
    'env' => 'production',
    'timezone' => 'America/New_York'
],
'settings' => [
    'logger' => [
        'path' => __DIR__ . '/../logs',
    ],
],

-----------------------------------------
AFTER -----------------------------------

'env' => 'production',

'logger' => [
    'path' => __DIR__ . '/../logs',
],

----------------------------------------
```
