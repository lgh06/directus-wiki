# Getting Started

## Composer dependency management

The Directus API is written in PHP and employs a number of third-party, open-source packages to manage routing, rendering, database access, and so on. See the core Composer documentation [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgetcomposer.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhxf8df2A4nLZIZrCVBRdpgDtF9Q).

Best practice [says](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgetcomposer.org%2Fdoc%2F01-basic-usage.md%23composer-lock-the-lock-file&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFiTope9TfHBzLrje3eM8CW_efAAg) that the composer.lock file should be tracked in the application repository. This helps to ensure stability by guaranteeing that over time, and across the development team, the versions of application dependencies will not change with each installation, but will remain exactly the same.

This is especially critical from the perspective of Directus code integration and inter-dependency integration. Case in point: the Slim package introduces in version 2.4 breaking changes in its integration with Twig. Therefore changes to the composer.lock file are extremely sensitive. Here are some guidelines on how to modify Directus’ composer dependencies.

### Never run composer.phar update
* This “updates” the version of each dependency to the latest version.
* If for whatever reason you need to re-install your vendors, always instead remove your vendor directory and re-run `composer.phar install`

### Avoid modifying the composer.json file directly
* Always modify dependencies using composer.phar because it will modify the lock file directly
* For example, to add a new dependency, run this command:
  * `composer.phar [require](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require) vendor/package:version`
  * This command updates your JSON file and your lockfile without changing the versions of your other dependencies.

## Requirements

* Apache HTTP Server
* MySQL Server
* PHP >5.2
* Git
* Composer

## Development Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Setup a development environment
You will need to setup a local *AMP environment (Apache, MySQL and PHP) in order to test Directus. *AMP packages can be found for different platforms:

* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) for Mac OS
* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows
* [LAMP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) for Linux

### Step 2: Install git
You will need Git to keep your test version of Directus up to date. Unless you already have Git installed, you can download it from [here](http://git-scm.com/).

### Step 3: Pull down Directus from github
Create a directory named "directus" in the www root. Next, open the directory in the terminal and type:

```
$ git init
$ git clone https://github.com/RNGR/Directus.git directus
```
### Step 4: Install dependencies
Directus uses composer to handle its php dependencies. Go to the `directus/api/` folder and install composer:

```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Then install the dependencies by executing:

```
$ php composer.phar install
```

### Step 5: Setup the database
The AMP-packages listed above all include Phpmyadmin. The following three steps need to be completed in order to setup the database

1. Create the database
   1. Databases -> Create Database
   2. Type *directus* as name and select *utf8_general_ci* as Collation.
2. Create a user
   1. Once you've created the database it will be visible in the left column – open it by clicking it.
   2. Privileges -> Add user
   3. Fill in *username* and *password*. Leave the other fields as defaults.
3. Import the database schema
   1. Import->File to Import->Choose file
   2. Open api/schema.sql
   3. Press Go

### Step 6: Setup Directus
Open `directus/api/config_sample.php` Add the database username and password from Step 5 to *DB_USER* and *DB_PASSWORD*. Save the file as ```directus/api/config.php```

```
define('DB_USER', 		'myusername');
define('DB_PASSWORD',	'mypassword');
```
### Step 7: Setup Files Uploads
This requires configuring your Storage Adapters. Currently the best way to do this is to manually edit the `directus_storage_adapters` table using a SQL client.

By default, `directus.sql` should contain two storage adapters out of the box, with the `DEFAULT` and `THUMBNAIL` roles, both using the `FileSystemAdapter` (meaning these will map to your local hard drive).

Simply define the `destination` (absolute path) and `url` (equivalent URL to the same directory) parameters of each of these records. For example, using a MAMP setup, you might define them this way:

```
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 1;
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media-thumbnails/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media-thumbnails/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 2;
```

### Step 8: Done!
Open directus by navigating to the path *directus* in your local host. Log in using the default user *admin@example.com* and password *password*


# Directus Folder Structure & Key Files

* **api**
    * Contains all server-side and lightly-abstracted database code.
* **app**
    * Contains all client-side application code.
    * core
    * **core-ui**
        * Contains all user-interfaces available within Directus core. These UIs should not be edited, deleted or added to – any UI customizations should be added to `/ui`.
    * modules
    * schema
    * **templates**
        * Contains all page html/handlebars markup for Directus
* **assets**
    * Contains all referenced less, js, css, font, and image files. The unbranded aspect of Directus means there should be no need to edit anything in this folder. All custom css and javascript should live within proprietary UIs, extensions, or list-views (see below).
* **bin**
* **dist**
* **extensions**
    * Contains any proprietary extensions your project may use. Extensions are a catch-all for CMS functionality, if it can't be handled by Directus core or UIs, then extensions are a sandbox for any Each extension present here is automatically loaded into the system unless prepended with an underscore ("_example"). Extensions are self contained, so all templates, logic, etc is within its own folder – for initial setup use the provided example as a guideline... just remember to remove the prepended underscore to activate.
* **installation**
    * Contains all the necessary files to install and setup Directus. Once completed, this entire folder can and should be removed. 
* **listviews**
    * Contains custom templates for proprietary item listing pages. As a primer, reference the core list views within `app/modules/xxx/views` until a proper example list view is included.
* **media_auth_proxy**
* **node_modules**
* **ui**
    * Contains custom UIs (user interfaces) which are used as the inputs for data within the framework. Proprietary UIs in this folder are supplementary to the _core_ UIs located within: `app/core-ui` – though the file structure/syntax is identical other than location. An `exampleui.js` file is included, but for more a more comprehensive understanding the core UIs should be perused. Any UIs added to this folder will be immediately available after refreshing the framework.

# Access Control List (ACL)

The access control layer was built in response to the need to maintain the privacy and integrity of certain pieces of data within the database, as managed by Directus. This functionality allows Directus administrators to prevent certain groups from reading and writing to specific fields, and from performing certain operations on given tables.

### The `directus_privileges` table
Each row on this table is associated with a table (`table_name`) and a Directus user group (`group_id`). Optionally, you can increase the fidelity of your privileges by setting the `status_id` to a an allowed status integer. For instance, you can define a user-group's view privileges for a table specifically  when the _status_ of a record is in draft mode. This might be useful if you'd like your "intern" user-group to only see draft content (not live/published).

The `read_field_blacklist` functions by omitting the given column from the database schema which the API yields, such that the front-end app has no awareness of this column. The `write_field_blacklist` prevents that user group from writing to this column.

The `nav_listed` boolean is used to hide certain tables from the Directus sidebar and table listing. In certain cases you may want records to be visible throughout the CMS (relationally or otherwise) but you don't need that table listed prominently otherwise. You can also use `directus_groups.nav_override` to achieve similar results, but for simply hiding a few tables that might be overkill.

The allow_[permission] columns determine which operations the group may perform on this table. Possible values are: `0` (not allowed), `1` (allowed for content you created), `2` (allowed for content anyone created). To differentiate between who created content (and take advantage of these granular privileges), you must set `directus_tables.user_create_column` to the field within that table which will track the Directus User-ID of the creator.
* `allow_view` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to view a table. Without this permission, the table will be completely omitted from the schema of users in this group.
* `allow_add` - [0,**1**] The ability to add new items to this table. A value of `2` is not an option since you can't _create_ someone else's content.
* `allow_edit` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to edit items from this table.
* `allow_delete` - [0,1,**2**] The ability to delete items from this table. 
* `allow_alter` - [0,**1**] The ability to modify the table's schema.


# Hooks

Hooks allow project-specific (non-Directus core) code to interact directly with Directus core events. The two hooks which are currently supported are `postUpdate` and `postInsert`, which enable logic to react to Directus record update and insert events, respectively. The hooks are very simple to implement: just add custom logic to the (untracked) config file at  /directus/api/configuration.php. [See this example configuration file as a reference.](https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/blob/f386da45a4957f776c4a701fdd31aae2c93e1273/api/configuration.example.php#L31)

# File Storage Adapters

Beyond local storage, Directus comes with the ability to connect to a number of popular file storage systems such as CDNs. As with most things within Directus, if you need something more specific the tools exist to easily implement a custom adapter. Storage Adapters enable a Directus instance to configure the destination for writing and reading the media which is loaded into the application. Within the database, they are defined by the `directus_storage_adapters` table. (Currently there is not an application-level interface to view or edit these.)

The PHP namespace for this logic is `\Directus\Media\Storage`. As of writing, three adapters exist:

* `AmazonS3Adaper` - Maps to Amazon S3 CDN Buckets
* `FileSystemAdapter` - Maps to local filesystem of the application server which hosts the Directus instance
* `RackspaceOpenCloudAdapter` - Maps to Rackspace OpenCloud CDN Containers

All adapters have these configurable parameters - each of which corresponds to a column on the `directus_storage_adapters` table:

`key` - A unique name for the storage adapter.
adapter_name” - The storage driver which this adapter should use (e.g. FileSystemAdapter, AmazonS3Adapter, etc).
`role` - Either “DEFAULT”, “THUMBNAIL”, or null. “DEFAULT” and “THUMBNAIL” should only occur once.
`public` - Either 1 or 0 (yes or no): should the contents of this storage adapter be accessible to non-Directus users?
`destination` - This value varies depending on the storage adapter
`url` - URL which maps to the contents of the storage adapter (trailing slash is required).
`params` - Optional JSON encoded set of additional parameters to be passed to the adapter.

### Roles

When Directus accepts a file upload, it will send the unaltered file to the storage adapter with the role “DEFAULT”. It will send the rendered thumbnail to the storage adapter with the role “THUMBNAIL”. These should only occur once within the table.

_As of writing, no other roles are in use._

### Adapter configuration

The significance and values of the destination and params options vary from adapter to adapter.

* FileSystemAdapter
  * `destination` - Absolute path on filesystem, no trailing slash
  * `params` - None
* AmazonS3Adapter (optional, must be included with composer)
  * `destination` - Name of S3 Bucket
  * `params` (required) - `api_key`, `api_secret`
* RackspaceOpenCloudAdapter (optional, must be included with composer)
  * `destination` - Name of OpenCloud Container
  * `params` (required) - `api_user`, `api_key`, `region`, `endpoint`

### Code samples

When building out Directus core functionality and derivative client functionality, it may be necessary to invoke the storage adapter component. Listed below are some references to code samples which demonstrate various ways of deploying storage adapters.

These links point directly to the commit hash which is current as of this writing, so that line numbers do not move out of sync with the documentation. Remember to compare these code snippets with the current state of Directus code in the future, and to update these docs if necessary.

`/directus/api/api.php`

The [definition of the upload route](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRNGR%2Fdirectus6%2Fblob%2Ff386da45a4957f776c4a701fdd31aae2c93e1273%2Fapi%2Fapi.php%23L781&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF61vBWbi9eTJc1FvUaSCXAnXM_uQ) shows the most generic (core) way of implementing the storage adapter interface.  We instantiate a new `\Directus\Media\Storage\Storage` object and then simply call the `acceptFile` method with the incoming local file. The interface automatically fetches the default/thumbnail adapters and passes this information to them.

`/directus/media_auth_proxy/index.php`

The authenticated media proxy front controller uses a [slightly more complex implementation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRNGR%2Fdirectus6%2Fblob%2Ff386da45a4957f776c4a701fdd31aae2c93e1273%2Fmedia_auth_proxy%2Findex.php%23L120&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFvgWXCSmwfnxuTzYVgymy3TNEujg). After identifying the Directus Media record being requested, it fetches the record for the corresponding storage adapter. It then passes this record to the method `\Directus\Media\Storage\Storage::getStorage`, which returns the corresponding adapter object, allowing the front controller to fetch the file contents abstractly, irrespective of the underlying driver / file location.

`/directus/bin/generateMissingThumbnails.php`

[This implementation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRNGR%2Fdirectus6%2Fblob%2Ff386da45a4957f776c4a701fdd31aae2c93e1273%2Fbin%2FgenerateMissingThumbnails.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFJOUy3bKpTj0W4XtYE5nwsP_9ZUg) uses the same approach as the authenticated media front controller, however it performs more complex operations, such as checking if a file exists, and writing a file to the adapter.
