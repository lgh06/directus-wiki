Content inputs and interfaces (UIs) are how you interact with the different types of content in your database. Each field in your database has a data-type that determines what kind of content can be stored there – Directus uses this information to determine which UIs are used.

# Core UIs

## Text
#### Text Field
A common, basic, single-line text field for almost any kind of shorter data. Characters remaining count on focus based on the field's length property.

#### Text Area
A common, basic, multi-line text field for longer textual data. It also includes a customizable set of formatting buttons.
* Height: This is the number of rows that this input will hold without scrolling
Don't add break tags: Turns off the use of the nl2br function. Useful for inputs for code, which typically disregards whitespace

#### Short Name
Often websites will need a identifier for URLs based on a title field rather than an id. This input type creates that URL safe automatically based on another input field.

#### Password
A text field that is masked from viewing.

#### Tags
A system for entering and saving comma-delimited tags. Tags are added upon hitting the comma or enter key and deleted by clicking the "x" beside the tag. The tags are saved into the database as a CSV string with commas at the beginning and end (",ranger,studio,range,") this lets you search for '%,range,%' to get exact results that do not include "ranger".

#### Numeric
A normal text field… that only accepts numbers (no decimal points)

#### Color
Accepts only 6 hexadecimal characters and provides a live colored square matching the value.

## Dates and Times
#### Datetime
The default (and only) input for the datetime datatype. It provides a dropdown for the month and numeric only fields for the day, year, hour, minute and second

#### Date
The default (and only) input for the date datatype. It provides a numerical-only text field for entering dates in the yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601) format. Upon clicking into the field, a date chooser is shown.

#### Time
The default (and only) input for the time datatype. It provides a numerical-only text field for entering times in the hh-mm-ss (ISO 8601) format.

#### Year
The default (and only) input for the year datatype. It provides a numerical-only, 4 character text field for entering a year in the yyyy (ISO 8601) format.

## Other
#### Relational
This input type allows for easy linking between fields/tables within Directus. Just write a quick MySQL query to return the allowed options and choose how you want the choices presented! This input type can give you an array of checkboxes, an array of radio buttons or our fancy selector (which allows for reordering). All values are saved as a comma delimited set of ids (or a field of your choice) with a comma at the beginning and end.

#### Select
Similar to the Relational input type above, sometimes you don't need/want to create a table to house dropdown options. This input will save non-relational items chosen from a set of given... options.

Style: Simple or Broad
Values (Comma separated): A CSV string of the allowed values of this field
#### Media
Accepts integers or decimals and displays the value as a star rating.

Extensions allowed: a CSV string of allowed extensions such as "jpg,gif,png" or "vimeo,youtube". Leave this field blank to accept all file types
New media only: disables the ability to choose from existing media
Thumbs on browse page: An integer of how many thumbnails should be visible on the browse page

#### Checkbox
The default choice for the tinyint data type. It saves a boolean 1 or 0.
