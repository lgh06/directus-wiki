 ## Debugging the App

 There are several ways to debug the app but the easiest way to do it is with the
 [Vue Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg). It's
 recommended to use the Vue Devtools with Chrome as the Devtools for Firefox are still really buggy.

> Computed Debugging To debug computed properties, it can be helpful to have a look at this
>  [Vue Guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity-computed-watchers.html#computed-debugging).

 ## Debugging the Api

 To debug the api, we recommend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with it's build in debugger.
 You first have to setup the config for starting the debugger. Create the following file
 `./directus/api/.vscode/launch.json` and paste in the following structure.

 ```json
 {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
         {
             "type": "pwa-node",
             "request": "launch",
             "name": "Debug Api",
             "skipFiles": [
                 "<node_internals>/**"
             ],
             "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/start.ts",
             "preLaunchTask": "npm: build",
             "outFiles": [
                 "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
             ]
         }
     ]
 }
 ```

> Disable Cache Make sure that you have caching disabled as it otherwise returns the cached response. To
>  disable this, goto your `.env` file in the api and set `CACHE_ENABLED` to `false`.

 Now you can start the api by going to the debugger view in VS Code, select to debug the Api and press `Start Debugging`.
 This runs the api and allows you to set breakpoints.
