# Custom Inputs (UIs)
Similar to extensions, if you need an input more specific to your application than provided by core Directus, you can duplicate, tweak, or create your own. Need a custom room-mapping interface or a proprietary client input? Just create a quick custom UI and it will immediately be available for use.

# Custom Extensions
By design, Directus keeps things simple. Only key features utilized by more than 80% of users make it into the core software. Anything not covered under the base suite is possible within extensions. Extensions take advantage of the system’s authentication, ACL, and data connections but force absolutely no restrictions. These sandboxed areas can be used to create custom interfaces, data-visualizations, interaction points, dashboards, point-of-sales, or anything else required by your project.

# Custom API Endpoints
If you’re using Directus' API endpoints (possibly feeding a mobile app or providing a SASS interface) you can always write custom endpoints to compliment the core data/schema/user access.

# File Storage Adapters
Beyond local storage, Directus comes with the ability to connect to a number of popular file storage systems such as CDNs. As with most things within Directus, if you need something more specific the tools exist to easily implement a custom adapter. Storage Adapters enable a Directus instance to configure the destination for writing and reading the media which is loaded into the application. Within the database, they are defined by the `directus_storage_adapters` table. (Currently there is not an application-level interface to view or edit these.) Head over to the advanced setup docs for more information on setting up custom File Storage Adapters.
